- [ ] Wake up at usual time  
       Actually, since there is no travel to work time involved, you can - and definitely should - skip your first couple alarms. If you are travelling to office üôå, take in the fresh air, sunlight and meet your team in person (lucky you!).

- [ ] Air out your room  
       It is highly important to air out your room, they said.

- [ ] Brew a good coffee or tea  
       No day should start without a coffee or tea, make one.

- [ ] Make breakfast  
       Or not, not everyone eats breakfast. And it's okay.

- [ ] Get on to your desk by 11-11:30 AM IST or a different based on what works for you and the team  
       Discuss with your project team on how you want to ensure there is adequate overlap in all of your schedules.

- [ ] Join to your daily standup meetings  
       Every team has their daily standup meetings around 11:00-13:00 IST.

- [ ] Get to work  
       You might want to follow [Design Life-Cycle of a Jira Issue](/checklist/design-life-cycle-of-a-jira-issue) or [Coding Life-Cycle of a Jira Issue](/checklist/coding-life-cycle-of-a-jira-issue)

- [ ] Prepare lunch  
       Make sure you have your lunch. Don't skip it!

- [ ] Check Slack for some more joke around  
       There is 100% a joke around going on in the #random channel.

- [ ] Get back to work  
       Pretty straight-forward, huh? Good.

- [ ] Check if it's ~19:30 IST  
       If so, it's end of day status updates on your project channel(s) and updating the PM tool, Tickspot, etc. Follow the [Daily Project Checklist](/checklist/daily-crm-reporting-checklist) to find out more.

- [ ] Come back to this checklist tomorrow
